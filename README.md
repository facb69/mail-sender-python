# python-mail
My first Python script. It sends e-mail messages with HTML/CSS and is highly customized.

WHAT YOU NEED

This was created as a single script. You'll need only a Linux environment with Python 3.8 (not tested in upper versions).

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES

It sends e-mail messages! To wherever you want from wherever you want.

HOW YOU USE IT

To use this script just run it right from the command line or you could call it from whitin your own application.

WHAT YOU MUST DO

Before using it, you must customized it! Fill in with your own e-mail credentials and make it static or pass them as parameters.

REMINDER

This is a work in progress. I'm changing it as my Python knowledge gets greater.

# python-mail


# <h3>My first Python script. It sends e-mail messages with HTML/CSS and is highly customizable.</h3>

<br/>

# WHAT YOU NEED

This was created as a single script. You'll need only a Linux environment with Python 3.8 (not tested in upper versions).

# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES

It sends e-mail messages! To wherever you want from wherever you want.

# HOW YOU USE IT

To use this script just run it right from the command line or you could call it from whitin your own application.

# WHAT YOU MUST DO

Before using it, you must customized it! Fill in with your own e-mail credentials and make it static or pass them as parameters.

# WARNING

If you pass a password as paremeter on the command line it will be registered in your user bash history. I didn't deal with security here since I developed this as a private project that runs on a controlled environment where only I have access.

# REMINDER

You are responsible for your data and system. In doubt, do not nothing! ðŸ˜‡

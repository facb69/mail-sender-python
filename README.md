# What you need

This was created as a single script. You'll need only a Linux environment with Python 3.8 (not tested in upper versions).

# What this script does

It sends e-mail messages! To whoever you want from wherever you want.

# How you use it

To use this script just run it right from the command line or you could call it from whitin your own application.

# What you must do

Before using it, you must customized it! Fill in with your own e-mail credentials and make it static or pass them as parameters.

# How you run it on command line

Just make it executable and run like this:

1) Without parameters: <i> ./python-mail.py </i>
2) With parameters: <i> ./python-mail.py "youremail" "yourpassword" "destionationmail" </i>

# Warning!

If you pass a password as paremeter on the command line it will be registered in your user bash history. I didn't deal with security here because I developed this as a private project that runs on a controlled environment where only I have access.

# Reminder

You are responsible for your data and system. In doubt, do nothing! ðŸ˜‡
